This is the Java implementation of the SimuRed Simulator.

It is a Netbeans project.

A clean build generates jar files in dist directory; you need all those jar files and subdirectories to run the app.
Alternatively, a single jar can be generated (after clean building) looking for the "build.xml" file in the tab "Files" of the project panel. Right click on that "build.xml" file and select "Run Target > Other Targets > package-for-store" and a single jar file will be created in the directory "store".
